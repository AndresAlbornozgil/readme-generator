# README Generator
  ## Description
  #### A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file from a user's input. I built it with the idea of not having to manually write a whole README file from scratch every time I start a new project. By using this README generator, developers will be able to spend less time writting a README and more precious time working on their project. By building this application, I learned that Node has become a game changer for developers wanting to use JavaScript beyond front-end web development.
